## Assignment
 
 This assignment will be described in multiple parts. You will need to
 write a report that answers the questions detailed below. Ultimately,
 you will need to complete the entire assignment in a **single R
 markdown** document that can be processed by **knitr** and be
 transformed into an HTML file.
 
 Throughout your report make sure you always include the code that you
 used to generate the output you present. When writing code chunks in
 the R markdown document, always use `echo = TRUE` so that someone else
 will be able to read the code. **This assignment will be evaluated via
 peer assessment so it is essential that your peer evaluators be able
 to review the code for your analysis**.
 
 For the plotting aspects of this assignment, feel free to use any
 plotting system in R (i.e., base, lattice, ggplot2)
 
 Fork/clone the [GitHub repository created for this
  assignment](http://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1). You
  will submit this assignment by pushing your completed files into your
  forked repository on GitHub. The assignment submission will consist of
 -the URL to your GitHub repository.
 +the URL to your GitHub repository and the SHA-1 commit ID for your
 +repository state.
  
  NOTE: The GitHub repository also contains the dataset for the
  assignment so you do not have to download the data separately.

  4. Push your `master` branch to GitHub.
  
  5. Submit the URL to your GitHub repository for this assignment on the course web site.
 +
 +In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will
 +need to submit the 40 character SHA-1 hash (as string of numbers from
 +0-9 and letters from a-f) that identifies the repository commit that
 +contains the version of the files you want to submit. You can do this
 +in GitHub by doing the following
 +
 +1. Going to your GitHub repository web page for this assignment
 +
 +2. Click on the "?? commits" link where ?? is the number of commits you have in the repository. For example, if you made a total of 10 commits to this repository, the link should say "10 commits".
 +
 +3. You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository. The most recent commit is at the very top. If this represents the version of the files you want to submit, then just click the "copy to clipboard" button on the right hand side that should appear when you hover over the SHA-1 hash. Paste this SHA-1 hash into the course web site when you submit your assignment. If you don't want to use the most recent commit, then go down and find the commit you want and copy the SHA-1 hash.
 +
 +A valid submission will look something like (this is just an **example**!)
